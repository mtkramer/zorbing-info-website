                <p>Zorbing is a popular activity in many countries outside of the United States. Zorbing typically
                    involves zorbonauts climbing inside a large beach ball, called a zorb, and traveling by running or
                    walking the zorb around a course. For a little more excitement, riders are strapped in and the zorb
                    is rolled down a hill. Zorbs can be used in all weather condidtions including in the snow and on the
                    water.

                <h2>Zorbing's Evil Twin</h2>
                <p>Zorbing should not be confused with water balling or water walking.</p>
                <image src="images\unsafewaterball3-crop.jpg"></image>
                <p>Water balling involves riding in an air-tight ball over water and therefore is much more dangerous
                    than zorbing. In <a
                        href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-444619/Bubble-trouble-scuppers-bid-walk-water.html">fact</a>,
                    the first person to develop a water ball for public production almost drown in freezing water while
                    demonstrating the product. For safety, water balls are tethered, which itself can also be hazardous
                    by getting snagged on passing boats or debris.</p>

                        Product Safety Commission (CPSC)</a> urges people to avoid this acitivity due to potential for
                    drowning, suffocation, heat exposure, and collisions with subsurface debris or boats. All of these
                    factors can be accounted for and the dangers can be minimized with a corresponding minimization of
                    the fun.

                <h2>Zorb Construction vs Water Ball</h2>
                <image src="images\beachzorb.jpg"></image>
                <image src="images\speedzorb.jpg"></image>
                <p>Zorbs are most commonly created from a toroid of PVC and filled with air. They can be formed into
                    doughnut shaped spheres, ovals, or cylinders depending on the desired activity. This structure
                    protects zorbonauts against external collisions and softens internal impacts by creating a cusion of
                    air between interior and exterior walls. Zorbs are dimpled where anchors attach the layers together
                    for structural integrity and durability. The ribs can be anchoring straps to maximize flexability
                    and zorbonaut comfort, struts to increase collision protection, or even hollow tubes to allow air or
                    water to move freely through the zorb. Lastly, zorbonauts have the option to be safety belted to an
                    interior wall before engaging in high speed rolling.

                <image src="images\waterball.jpg"></image>
                <p>Water balls only have one air-tight layer to minimally allow the rider to float and breathe for about
                    4 hours of low activity. Both water balls and zorbs can have handle grips for entry/exit or loops
                    for pre-launch orientation and transport.</p>

                <p>Zorbs can be produced in many different ways. Their form is sometimes a priority over their function.

                <h3>Warmzorbs</h3>
                <p>In winter, zorbs can be left out like igloos for people to warm up within or just as portable
                    shelters
                    from chilly winds and rains.</p>

                <p>Zorbs can also be lined with a material that cause echos. Try singing in one! (don't really, this is
                    a prank played on rookies)</p>

                <h2>Zorb Safety</h2>
                <p>Typical use zorbing can occasionally cause bruises, dizziness, and vomitting. Sometimes sprains and
                    fractures can happen when running inside them and when the entrance opening is not avoided. One
                    person was killed by high speed collisions with rocks while falling down a ski slope in Russia. A
                    teacher was killed and a student was critically injured when a safety net failed to stop their zorb.
                </p>
                <p>Please zorb responsibly and never alone.</p>

                <h3>Disclaimer:</h3>
                <p>I am not an expert zorber nor professional stuntman. In fact, I have no actual experience zorbing, at
                    all. <strong>None.</strong></p>
                <p>Nothing in the following sections should actually be attempted by anybody at any time. They are
                    merely thought experiments for entertainment only. But, wouldn't many activities be more exciting
                    while zorbing? For starters, you could get a zorb massage.</p>
                <image src="images\masagezorb.jpg"></image>
                <p>Or changeup the rules of zorb bowling.</p>
