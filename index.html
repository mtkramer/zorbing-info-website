                <p>Zorbing is a popular activity in many countries outside of the United States. Zorbing typically
                    involves zorbonauts climbing inside a large beach ball, called a zorb, and traveling by running
                    or walking the zorb around a course. For a little more excitement, riders are strapped in and the
                    zorb is rolled down a hill. Zorbs can be used in all weather condidtions including in the snow and
                    on the water.
                </p>
                <h2>Zorbing's Evil Twin</h2>
                <p>Zorbing should not be confused with water balling or water walking.</p>
                <img class="wide" src="images\unsafewaterball3-crop.jpg">
                <p>Water balling involves riding in an air-tight ball over water and therefore is much more dangerous
                    than zorbing. In <a
                        href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-444619/Bubble-trouble-scuppers-bid-walk-water.html">fact</a>,
                    the first person to develop a water ball for public production almost drown in freezing water
                    while demonstrating the product. For safety, water balls are tethered, which itself can also be
                    hazardous by getting snagged on passing boats or debris.</p>

                        Product Safety Commission (CPSC)</a> urges people to avoid this acitivity due to potential
                    for drowning, suffocation, heat exposure, and collisions with sunken debris or boats. All of
                    these factors can be accounted for and the dangers can be minimized with a corresponding
                    minimization of the fun.

                <h2>Zorb Construction vs Water Ball</h2>
                <img src="images\speedzorb.jpg">
                <img src="images\beachzorb.jpg">
                <p>Zorbs are most commonly created from a toroid of PVC and filled with air. They can be formed into
                    doughnut shaped spheres, ovals, or cylinders depending on the desired activity. This structure
                    protects zorbonauts against external collisions and softens internal impacts by creating a cusion of
                    air between interior and exterior walls. Zorbs are dimpled where ribs attach the layers together
                    for structural integrity and durability. The ribs can be anchoring straps to maximize flexability
                    and zorbonaut comfort, struts to increase collision protection, or even hollow tubes to allow air or
                    water to move freely through the zorb. Lastly, zorbonauts have the option to be safety belted to an
                    interior wall before engaging in high speed rolling.
                </p>

                <p style="float:right;transform:translate(0%, 100%);width:45%">Water balls only have one air-tight layer
                    to minimally allow the rider to float and breathe for about 4 hours of low activity. Both water
                    balls and zorbs can have handle grips for entry and exit or loops for pre-launch orientation and
                    transport.</p>

                <h2>Zorb Safety</h2>
                <p>Typically, zorbing is a very safe activity. However, zorbing can occasionally cause bruises,
                    dizziness, and vomitting. Sometimes sprains and fractures can happen when running inside them and
                    when the entrance opening is not avoided. One person was killed by high speed collisions with rocks
                    while rolling down a ski slope in Russia. A teacher was killed and a student was critically injured
                    when a safety net failed to stop their zorb.
                </p>
                <p>Please zorb responsibly and never alone.</p>

                <h3>Disclaimer:</h3>
                <p>I am not an expert zorber nor professional stuntman. In fact, I have no actual experience zorbing, at
                    all. <strong>None.</strong></p>
                <p>Nothing in the following sections should actually be attempted by anybody at any time. They are
                    merely thought experiments for entertainment only.</p>
                <p>But, wouldn't many activities be more exciting
                    while zorbing? For starters, you could get a zorb massage.</p>

                <p>Or changeup the rules of zorb bowling.</p>
