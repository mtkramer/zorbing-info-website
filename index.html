                <h3>Zorb Construction</h3>
                <p>Zorbing should not be confused with water balling. Zorbs are most commonly composed of two layers of
                    durable pvc with an air cusion between them to soften external impacts with objects and to soften
                    internal impacts from occupants bouncing against walls. Water balls only have one layer to minimally
                    allow them to float with a rider walking or crawling inside. Zorbers have the option to run or walk
                    or to be imobilized by being strapped down for high speed rolling. The last important difference is
                    that Zorbs are dimpled to anchor the outside and inside layers to each other which strengthens the
                    cusioning effects and zorb durability.

                <h3>The Zorbing</h3>
                <p>Pure zorbing involves traveling by running or walking the zorb around a course. For a little more
                    excitement, riders are strapped down and the zorb is rolled down a hill. Zorbs can be used in all
                    weather condidtions including in the snow and on the water.</p>
