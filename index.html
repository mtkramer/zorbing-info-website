            <p>As far as her memory goes, there was time for friends, work, lounging. This was something that was never
                planned for. Never scheduled. How could it have been missed for so long? So important now, it was the
                priority. Now it was the secret.</p>
            <p>"Sorry, I can't," Val says, her tone lowers.</p>
            <p>"Oh," Rian blinks and looks to the left. "What about later? Come on. Please don't make me ask Miguel.
                He'll bring Brutus."</p>
            <p>"Later is fine," Val struggles to move from the akwardness.</p>
            <p>"Okay, good," Rian smiles and stares. "I have to run. Talk to you later boss."</p>
            <p>"Later this weekend?" she thought. "I'll have to ask."</p>
            <p>Val walks back to her couch and falls into the cusions.</p>
            <p>"Wow... Did you see how lame that was?" MaLady teases asks Brutus. She pats him on the head, his panting
                ceases, and his eyes close.</p>
            <p>"I don't know what you're talking about." Val buries her attention in her laptop.</p>
            <p>"If you don't act interested..."</p>
            <p>"Again," BrutusAI says when MaLady stops patting and his eyes open.</p>
            <p>"Will you get back to work," Val orders. "We all have more important things to do."</p>
            <p>"No, you don't," MaLady hisses, stands, and stomps away.</p>
            <p>Val glances around the room to see if there is an audience.</p>
