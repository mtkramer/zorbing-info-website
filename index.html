                <h3>Zorb Construction</h3>
                <p>Zorbing should not be confused with water balling. Zorbs are most commonly composed of two layers of
                    durable pvc with an air cusion between them to soften external impacts with objects in the
                    environment and to soften internal impacts from riders being thrown against walls. Water balls only
                    have one layer to allow them to float with a rider inside. </p>
