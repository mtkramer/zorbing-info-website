                <h2>Pure Zorbing and It's Evil Twin</h2>
                <p>Zorbing is a popular activity in many countries outside of the United States. It typically involves
                    traveling by running or walking the zorb around a course. For a little more excitement, riders are
                    strapped in and the zorb is rolled down a hill. Zorbs can be used in all weather condidtions
                    including in the snow and on the water.</p>
                <p>Zorbing should not be confused with water balling which is not only much less safe that zorbing, but
                    illegal in some states.</p>

                <h2>Zorb Construction</h2>
                <p>Zorbs are most commonly composed of two layers of durable pvc with an air cusion between them to
                    soften external impacts with objects and to soften internal impacts from occupants bouncing against
                    walls. Water balls only have one layer to minimally allow them to float with a rider walking or
                    crawling inside. Zorbers have the option to run or walk or to be imobilized by being strapped down
                    for high speed rolling. The last important difference is that Zorbs are dimpled to anchor the
                    outside and inside layers to each other which strengthens the cusioning effects and zorb durability.
